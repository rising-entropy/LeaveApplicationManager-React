## Leave Application Manager in React

#### Plan of Action:
- Backend FastAPI (Python) - Done, Deployed
- Frontend React - Redux, Redux-Saga, Formik, Axios


To practice the use of Class-Based components, largely all components involving states would be _class-based_.

All the state-management would take place using the Redux store. (I am still studying Redux-Toolkit and would probably implement the same).

The use of APIs would use Redux-Saga. As discussed in the sync-up - it's pointless to keep making a GET request all the time for the same data (say User Profile). Making use of this would hence be the optimal way.

Axios - _application/json_ and _multipart-form_ would suffice for the API integration.
